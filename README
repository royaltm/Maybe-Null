Usage:

from maybe import Maybe

Maybe(someobj).someproperty.somemethod()

returns Null() instead of raising AttributeError if someobj is None

opts = {'person': 'Very important person'}

len(Maybe(opts).get('person'))

21

len(Maybe(opts).get('robot'))

0

opts = None

len(Maybe(opts).get('robot'))

0


Testing against None.

1. by equality and identity:
from maybe import Value

someobj = None

Value(Maybe(someobj)) is None
True

Maybe(someobj) == None
True


2. by instance check

from maybe import Null
someobj = None

isinstance(Maybe(someobj), Null)
True

isinstance(someobj, Null)
True
